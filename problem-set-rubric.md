# Rubric for writing up problems on problem sets and quizzes

## Analysis of algorithms

## CSCI 405

Automatic deductions: 

- Failure to either list group members or state that you worked alone: -10 pts.
- Work is not typed (except possibly figures): no credit.

Components required for full credit on each problem: 

1. Explanation of steps to arise at answer (~50-70% of pts):
    - This should be a combination of prose written in complete sentences plus math as needed.
    - The best explanations for a problem that asks for “an algorithm” will explain the pseudocode that’s given using a combination of comments within the code and around a paragraph of writing that says what it does.
    - The best explanations for an analysis problem will include two parts:
        - Intuition for the result explained in words, usually with minimal math.
        - An actual proof using math. This does not have to be extremely formal but should cover the correct logic. The problems in the homework can all be solved using the proof techniques that you learned in 301 and that we cover in class. Often people provide an intuitive explanation but skip a proof and are surpised when they lose points.
2. Correct answer (~30-50% of pts): Either a mathematical/analytical result or code/pseudocode. Pseudocode following the conventions of the book is strongly preferred to actual code. If you want to present an algorithm in a language closest to pseudocode, Python is best but avoid list comprehensions and other idiosyncratic pythonic ways of doing things.

 
Examples of other things that can cause you to lose points: 

- Skipping a step in an explanation/derivation (often minor).
- Using a complicated formula or result without explaining where it comes from. If you found a formula in the book or internet, reference the source.
- Poorly organized.
