405 Intro Week
--------------

- Syllabus overview

We will focus our writing this quarter on issues surrounding algorithms and
their use in society. We will do most of our writing in-class, in the form of
paragraph answers on quizzes in response to assigned readings. We will also work on
outline construction such as you would use for longer written pieces. Be sure to bring something to write
with (or a laptop) to class.


We will have a quiz this Friday on the syllabus as well as this week's assigned
reading, will also check in about your experience in 305 (ungraded "pre-quiz").

Icebreaker: 2 truths and 1 lie

- Groups of 4 (count off to 8)
- 3 minutes to write down truths and a lie
- Go around and share; after each share, group votes on the lie
- Reveal the actual lie after the vote

After finishing, go around to introduce yourselves and share 1 truth

Think-pair-share: What makes a "good" algorithm?

Is an efficient algorithm always good? Jevon's paradox.

We can analyze algorithms from multiple lenses:

- Resource Efficiency
- Practical usefulness, understandability
- Organizational culture
- Economics
