# Welcome!

Welcome to CSCI 405, our second course on rigorous analysis of data structures and
algorithms.

Learning to think rigorously about computation is a most excellent endeavor.

This class is foundational for algorithm development, and I am so excited for
this quarter!

# Instructor

- Alexandra Nilles, Ph.D. (prefers "Professor Nilles" in class, she/her/hers, how to pronounce)
- Office: KB 403D
- Office hours (3-4pm Weds) (KB 403D or Zoom): calendly to schedule (not required)
- Email: [nillesa2@wwu.edu](nillesa2@wwu.edu)

Be aware that if you email me after 5pm on a Friday, I likely won't reply before Monday morning.

# Course Outcomes

After this course, you will demonstrate:

- Thorough understanding of the mathematical techniques used to determine the time and space
complexity of algorithms.
- Thorough understanding of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and an ability to 
discern which technique to use for a given problem.
- Thorough understanding of graph algorithms for minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, and 
maximum network flows.
- Thorough understanding of randomized algorithms.
- Ability to formulate efficient, effective solutions for various problems and justify the 
correctness and complexity of those solutions.

These outcomes will be evaluated via a midterm exam, final exam, quizzes and homework
assignments.

In addition, this course provides 1 Writing Point and we will practice and
evaluate technical writing skills.

# Textbooks

The assigned readings will be from Algorithms by Jeff Erickson, available free in digital format here:
[https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)

The textbook is also available as a self-published hard copy, and options for purchase can be found at the link above.

An additional reference that you may find useful is "Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Edition", by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, but you are not required to purchase this book.

# Grader Info

# Course Format

There will be a combination of lectures, in-class problem solving time, quizzes and homework throughout the course. There will also be a midterm and a final.

# Quizzes

We will have in-class quizzes most Fridays. The quizzes will be designed to take 15 minutes and you will have 30 minutes to complete them. They will be available on paper and on Canvas. The single lowest quiz score will be dropped.

Quizzes taken out of class (ie: while home sick) are eligible for up to 85%
credit. Quizzes may not be taken after the Canvas quiz closes.

# Lectures

Lectures are MTWF. Classes will be face to face and synchronous in CF 025. Instructor will post lecture notes
by the end of day after each lecture.

# Assignments

There will be homework assignments most weeks. You must turn in the work on
Canvas by the specified due time.

All work **must be typed**. You are not required to use $\LaTeX$.

Expectations for assignments:

- **Show your work**. An answer alone, or just math, will not get you full
credit (at minimum, you must define your symbols).
- Clarity and organization of presentation count.
- Group work is allowed on take-home problem sets unless explicitly stated that
it should be individual work. An ideal group size is three people.
- Each student must write up and submit their own answers, and must **list all
group members at the top of the assignment submission**.
- If you end up using external resources (the textbook, StackOverflow, etc.),
you must rewrite the argument or proof in your own words, and cite the external
resource. We highly recommend trying the problems by yourself, first!
- As a four credit hour course with four contact hours per week, expect to spend
approximately 8 hours each week on independent work. If you are spending
significantly more time than this, come talk to the instructor in office hours
or arrange a meeting to discuss strategies.


## Late Assignment Policy

You may request two extensions on the homework. Each extension will add one week to the homework
due date.
No reasons needed, just send me an email with your name stating you are
requesting your first or second extension. Send this email **before the homework
is due** (same night is OK). Extensions cannot be applied retroactively after
24hrs have passed from the homework due time.

All late submissions will be subject to a penalty of -10% per day submitted beyond the
due date.

# Midterm and Final Exam

There will be one midterm and one final exam. You are allowed one single-sided 8.5"x11" page of typed or handwritten notes for each exam.
This note sheet will be collected with your exam.

# Participation

**Showing up for class is expected.** Missing a significant number of classes
will negatively affect your grade.

In class, you will be asked to think about questions on your own, write down
answers, consult small groups, and share with the class. My goal is to give
everyone enough time to think through things before being put "on the spot." It
is always ok to say "I don't know", but as learners we will strategize how to
move past "I don't know"!

A good participation grade can be accomplished through a combination of:

- active and professional participation in in-class activities and discussions
- positive participation in the online discussion server for the class
- reflection and identification of growth areas in self-assessment
- office hours visits

# Grading

Your grades will be determined by the following distribution:

- Homework: 30%
- Quizzes: 15%
- Participation: 10%
- Midterm: 20%
- Final: 25%
- Total: 100%

| If you get at least | Your grade is at least |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 97% | A+ (recorded as A by the University, but ask and I will give you a sticker) |
| 93% | A |
| 90% | A- |
| 87% | B+ |
| 83% | B |
| 80% | B- |
| 77% | C+ |
| 73% | C |
| 70% | C- |
| 67% | D+ |
| 63% | D |
| 60% | D- |

# Academic Integrity

I encourage you to learn together. Participate in class, and form study groups outside of class. Feel free to discuss homework problems -- but you must write all the code, proofs, and analysis yourself. DO NOT copy code, DO NOT share answers, and DO NOT plagiarize. You won't learn very much by cheating, and that is not the way to learn computer science (it is the way to embarrass yourself during technical interviews). This extends to online sources like Stack Overflow, Github, CHAT-GPT, etc. If you're stuck, please ask for help from other students, from the TA, or the instructor. Don't take shortcuts by not doing your own work.

I highly recommend reading the [policies](https://policy.wwu.edu/POL-U2100.02-Ensuring-Academic-Honesty) and
[examples](https://academichonesty.wwu.edu/examples-of-behaviors-that-lack-integrity/)
of violations. The course instructor must report all suspected violations.

If you are caught cheating, you will fail the course immediately.

# Use of AI

Using AI tools to directly produce code or proofs is not allowed in this course.
Suspected AI use will trigger an academic integrity violation.
This will begin with an in-person conversation about the content suspected to have been plagarized.

# Conduct

I am committed to maintaining an inclusive, supportive, and professional environment in all academic settings including lectures, labs, and course-related online spaces.
Students are expected to live up to the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This is the ethical code adopted by every responsible software professional. Failing to follow the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct or the Student Code of Conduct can negatively affect course grades up to and including a failing grade for the course.

Filming or recording classes is not allowed without express written consent of the instructor. Class content (including photos of slides) are not to be shared online.

All the policies in the general WWU syllabus policy apply to this course: https://syllabi.wwu.edu/

Please report conduct violations to the professor.
